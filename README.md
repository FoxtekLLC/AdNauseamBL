# AdNauseam Block List

This repository is up-to-date as of **2023-05-20**

⚠️ **NOTICE:** ⚠️ \
This project is in no way, shape, or form related to the [AdNauseam](https://adnauseam.io) project, team, and/or browser extension.

## Purpose

This repository, AdNauseamBL, serves to be yet another source of DNS-level (or simple `/etc/hosts` file) blocking of domains/TLDs/IPs. \
*If you would like to convert this list into a hosts-file format, then please submit a pull request with the conversion and it may be merged!*

As of this moment, this repository serves to only provide a block file to block domains using generic TLDs (gTLDs) that are based on file extentions
that a gracious mega-corporation[^1][^2][^3] has unfavourably allowed to be registered as internet domains.

## Exceptions

Despite this blocklist mainly existing to block file extension based TLDs, exceptions are granted to select TLDs. Below is a list of TLDs excluded from this list.

|**TLD**|**Exemption Reason**|
|:---:|:---:|
|**.rs**|Primarily used for [rust-lang](https://rust-lang.org/) and [cargo](https://cargo.io/) projects|
|**.sh**|Primarily used for diskless install scripts, typically in Shell Script[^4]|
